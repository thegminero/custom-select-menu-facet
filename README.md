# custom-select-menu-facet

##Pre-deployment considerations

- Replace AppId, searchApi key and index name in `components/results-page.js`

- Replace the attribute names you want to display options for in index.html as well as tab headers and so on.

- Replace hit properties in the `templates/result-hit.js`


## Run the App

Run `npm run install` to install dependencies

Run `npm run start` to view how the custom facet dropdown works.
